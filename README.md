# ‚úàÔ∏èüß≥ AeroAI: AI-based Travel Agent
This project demonstrates the ability to use LangGraph to create an intelligent travel assistant that can search flights, book hotels, and send customized emails using various language models (LLMs). The agent's functions include interacting with users, bringing up the required tools, and offering a smooth travel planning experience.

## **Features**

- **Stateful Interactions**: To provide a seamless user experience, the agent remembers user interactions and picks up where it left off.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical actions, such as checking travel plans before sending emails, are within the user's control.
- **Dynamic LLM Usage**: For a variety of tasks, such as email production and tool invocation, the agent intelligently alternates between multiple LLMs.
- **Email Automation**: Automatically generates and sends detailed travel plans to users via email.
